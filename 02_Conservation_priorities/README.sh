To be retained, a specied required a least one criterion to be met with a high score (2), or meet the conservation status criteria.
Fishbase data were obtained by emailing Deng Palomares. 
- Vulnerability to climate: Fishbase, from Jones et al., (2017). Moderate/Moderate to High = 1; High to Very High = 2
- Vulnerability to fishing: extracted from Fishbase, criteria described in Cheung et al., (2005), go from 0-100, then converted from Low to very-high category. No score for marine mammals Moderate/Moderate to High = 1; High to Very High = 2

- Trophic level: Fishbase

- Upper level predators: From Fishbase, Score based on lenght and trophic level (2 if lenght > 90 and trophic level >4; 1 if trophic level between 3-4 and size higher than 55, 0 if size lower than 55)
marine mammals are turned to 2

- Forage species: From Gale et al., added Northern anchovies as it meet criterias from Gale et al 2018: locally abundant, TL < 3.5 (3.1), aggregating or schooling, important prey for multiple species in BC (need ref)
list of added species:
Ammodytes personatus et hexapterus: score of 2
Engraulis mordax changed from 1* to 2 due to high documentation on their abundance in the Salish sea, especially in Howe Sound (pietsch and Orr 2015 and others)

- Nutrient transporting species: from Gale et al., known to migrate and transport nutrients
Salmo salar:1 (not sure if established populations)
Salvelinus malma (2), Gadus chalcogrammus (1)

- Conservation concern score: from Gale et al
88 species not listed in the paper, these species were checked against IUCN, BCwildspecies, SARA/COSEWIC and BC_list
only S. confluentus is considered vulnerable in BC_list and BCwildspecies, score 1 according to Gale et al
